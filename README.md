# ü•è Flying Discs

This Python repository contains modules and algorithms that can calculate trajectories of flying sports discs. The repository includes non-physical and physical model based algorithms and parameterizations for calculating the trajectories.

### ü§î Why create this project?

This project can be used by researchers, sports enthusiasts, and anyone interested in studying or improving the performance of flying sports discs. The open-source nature of this project also allows for contributions and enhancements by the community, further improving its capabilities and usefulness.

## üî¨ Included disc models

## üöÄ Get Started

#### Installation

```bash
pip3 install flying-discs
```

### üë©‚Äçüè´ Example

Jupyter notebooks can be found under [notebooks](notebooks/).

#### Morrison Example

```python
from flying_discs.morrison.constants import MorrisonUltrastar
from flying_discs.morrison.coordinates import MorrisonPosition3D
