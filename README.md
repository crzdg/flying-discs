# ü•è Flying Discs

This Python repository contains modules and algorithms that can calculate trajectories of flying sports discs. The repository includes non-physical and physical model based algorithms and parameterizations for calculating the trajectories.

### ü§î Why create this project?

This project can be used by researchers, sports enthusiasts, and anyone interested in studying or improving the performance of flying sports discs. The open-source nature of this project also allows for contributions and enhancements by the community, further improving its capabilities and usefulness.

## üî¨ Included disc models

## üöÄ Get Started

#### Installation

```bash
pip3 install flying-discs
```

### üë©‚Äçüè´ Example

Jupyter notebooks can be found under [notebooks](notebooks/).

#### Morrison Example

```python
from flying_discs.morrison.constants import MorrisonUltrastar
from flying_discs.morrison.coordinates import MorrisonPosition3D
from flying_discs.morrison.linear import MorrisonLinearCalculator

disc = MorrisonLinearCalculator(MorrisonUltrastar())

Z0 = 1
TIMESCALE = 0.033
ANGLE_OF_ATTACK = 5
V0 = 14
DIRECTION_ANGLE = 0

throw = disc.calculate_trajectory(
    MorrisonPosition3D(0, 0, Z0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0),
    V0,
    ANGLE_OF_ATTACK,
    DIRECTION_ANGLE,
    TIMESCALE,
)
```
