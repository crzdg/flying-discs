# ü•è Flying Discs

This Python repository contains modules and algorithms that can calculate trajectories of flying sports discs. The repository includes non-physical and physical model based algorithms and parameterizations for calculating the trajectories.

### ü§î Why create this project?

This project can be used by researchers, sports enthusiasts, and anyone interested in studying or improving the performance of flying sports discs. The open-source nature of this project also allows for contributions and enhancements by the community, further improving its capabilities and usefulness.

## üî¨ Included disc models

## üöÄ Get Started

#### Installation

```bash
pip3 install flying-discs
```

### üë©‚Äçüè´ Example

Code examples and Jupyter notebooks can be found under [examples](examples/).

#### Morrison Example

```python
from flying_discs.morrison.disc_morrison_linear import DiscMorrisonLinear
from flying_discs.morrison.morrison_constants import DiscMorrisonUltrastar

x0 = 0
y0 = 0
z0 = 1

disc = DiscMorrisonLinear(DiscMorrisonUltrastar(), x0, y0, z0)

timescale = 0.033
angle_of_attack = 5
v0 = 14
direction = 0

trajectory = disc.calculate_trajectory(
    timescale,
    alpha=angle_of_attack,
    v0=v0,
    direction=direction,
)
```

### üìÉ Documentation

Some doc-strings are already added. Documentation is a work-in-progress and will be updated on a time by time basis.
